# AirlineTicketReservation
Write a simple airline ticket reservation program. The program should display a menu with the following operations: reserve a ticket, cancel a reservation, check whether a ticket is reserved for particular person, and display the passengers. The information is maintained on an alphabetized linked list of names. In a simper version of the program, assume that tickets are reserved for only one flight. In a fuller version, place no limit on the number of flights. Create a linked list of flights with each node including pointer to a linked list of passengers.
